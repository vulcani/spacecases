SPACECASES RPG
==============

This system is intended to be based off of the Divinity: Original Sin Action Point system for combat/actions. It uses a running total of action "points" which are used in any time pressure situations and also employs percentage chances for dictating action success. The idea is to create a sense of balance and easy crossover between classic character archetypes while making a modern combat system that breaks out of the *one turn, one action* mold.


### Character Base Statistics:
Every character will have core statistics that are drawn from classic systems that dictate primary capabilities. They are as follows:

* Brawn: This is a measure of raw character strength and brute force. Increasing brawn increases a person's relative ability to attack with strength-based weapons, perform feats of strength and carry weight. Also, adds HP.

* Awareness: An aware person is more skilled with using aim-based weapons and is more apt at any spacial or awareness-based abilities. Aware people also react faster to any danger, and thus have more initative.

* Endurance: Built through years of aerobic conditioning and proper diet, endurance measures an individual's ability to shrug off harm and endure. It affects all saves and is the primary stat for HP.

* Speed: A literal measure of speed, fast characters are efficient with their actions, gaining more action points in combat. They also move faster when necessary, and they are slightly faster to react to the beginning of a combat, gaining initiative.

* Intelligence: As a measure of what knowledge has gained in life, intelligence helps a character with any knowledge-based actions and skills. In combat, any casters or special abilities involving the knowledge base of a character relies on intelligence, and it often gives awareness of options otherwise not noticed.

* Wisdom: A wise character knows how to act, when to act and how to interact with their surroundings. Although it does not directly aid any actions, the wisdom of a character helps them with decision-making , creatprocesses and information processing. As such, wiser characters are more adept at talking to people and can store more action points than others. They also start with more wealth.


Each character has a base value of 5 in each with 5 extra points to allocate at level 1. 5 is considered /average/ for a human being in each attribute. Points can be subtracted from some and given to others at level 1 at the GM's discretion.

### Character Health:
Like in D&D, each character has some measure of how healthy they are, called hit points or HP. Each character has a starting HP total of 40 x (.2 x Endurance + .1 x (Brawn - .5)), such that each point of endurance over 5 raises the starting total by 8 (20%) and each point of Brawn over 5 raises the starting total by 4 (10%). Max HP may be raised or lowered by effects in-game, but otherwise current HP may not exceed this total. A character is unconscious at a HP level of 0. They are dead at an HP level of -50% of their total and are obliterated at -100% of their total. Additionally, when brought back to consciousness, a character will be Fatigued for one hour and have a major injury as rolled fro
m the following D100 table(reroll any nonsensical values):

* 00-09: Broken Secondary Arm-cannot be used for any actions, lose 20% of maximum HP. Lasts for a month unless treated.

* 10-19:Broken Primary Arm-cannot be used for any actions, lose 20% of maximum HP. Lasts for a month unless treated.

* 20-29:Broken Leg-you are effectively crippled. Lasts for a month unless treated.

* 30-34:Brain Injury-You have Intelligence and Wisdom -1, losing use of a skill rank. Lasts until the end of the day unless treated.

* 35-44:Niggling Injury-You have Endurance -2. Lasts for a week unless treated.
* 45-54:Weak-You are weak until the end of the day unless treated.
* 55-59:Back Spasms-Performing strenuous actions gives a 20% chance of being stunned for a turn instead. Lasts for a week unless treated.
* 60-69:Sensitive Wounds-Performing strenuous actions gives a 20% chance of gaining bleeding 5. Lasts for three days unless treated.
* 70-99:You are just Fatigued for one hour-no major injury.

Proper first aid is vital for preventing or treating major injuries as well as stabilizing characters in critical condition. See first aid supplies to view their effects on injured players. Also, we maintain the D&D 10% per turn stabilization rule.


## Combat
### Initiative/Surprise Round

Whenever a character wishes to initiate aggressive action, an initiative round ensues. If an enemy is unaware when a character initiates combat, they must make a morale save given by the initiatorâ€™s Sneak check (so, like saving against a sneak check but with morale bonuses/penalties added) or be surprised. If surprised, a character rolls initiative like normal, but will not act on the first round and will lose any dodge modifier during the first round. All characters rolling for initiative roll 1d100 + 5% x Awareness + 10% x Perception + 2% x Speed. Characters are ranked by their rolls to dictate turn order. The person who goes first gains an extra 2 AP for the first turn as a bonus for initiating action. Any character may delay initiative to any lower value, passing priority between teams until one relents (highest initial roll get choice). You maintain your bonus 2 AP even if you delay.
On Your Turn:
Begin your turn by increasing your AP by your AP generation (6 at s of 5, +/- 1 for every +/- 2 Speed) after all relevant modifiers. Mark this total on a die. Perform any desired actions in order, marking down the running AP total as you do so. Declare the end of your turn and maintain banked AP on the die for tracking purposes. You may bank up to (6 + Wisdom) AP.

### Status Effects List:
* Stunned-You lose all AP generation for the stunned turns, and you may not perform any actions during your turn. You lose your dodge modifier while stunned.

* Crippled-You lose your dodge modifier until the injury is fixed, have -2 Speed and cannot run.

* Knocked Down-You lose your dodge modifier while knocked down, and must spend 3 AP to sho up on your turn. Standing up incurs melee attacks of opportunity and may be especially difficult, if the person is wearing heavy armor or something similar. This status cannot be saved against on a later turn.

* Slowed-You lose one third of your AP generation each turn while slowed, rounded to the nearest. Your movement also costs double the AP.

* Weakened-You have -2 Brawn, -1 Endurance and -2 Awareness.

* Broken Limb-The limb may not be used until fixed, and you lose 20% of your current health and max health, rounded down.

* Bleeding-The wound bleeds for the specified amount every turn at the beginning of your turn until patched. Double currently held bleeding stacks if you use an adrenaline round.

* Charmed-You are controlled by an enemy on your normal turn. They do not get knowledge of your abilities and only have knowledge of currently held equipment. They may not cause any direct harm to you during these turns.

* Fatigued-You have Awareness -2, Speed -2, and Wisdom -2

* Flanked-You are 10% easier to hit from anyone who is flanking you. Note that cover is directional and may affect only one of your attackers.

* Dazed-You may not perform any aggressive actions/abilities and may not bank AP. You lose all of your banked AP when first dazed. On future turns, they may make a new mental save at the beginning of their turn to eliminate the effect.

* Blind-You cannot receive any visual information, lose your dodge modifier and must make an save of 75% - 5% x Awareness after deciding your actions for a turn or be reoriented randomly via D8. You may still choose to attack, but you must choose a vector of attack and have -20% chance to hit versus enemies.

* Feared-On each turn, roll 1D6: 1-2:Fight frantically 3-4:Flee 5:Cower 6:Surrender
