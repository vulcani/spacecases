If ingested, you will heal 15 + 3 for each 10% over the next two hours. Requires 4 AP to use.

Gain +30% to all saves that either cripple you or break a limb. Also, if these effects come up on the major injury table, you have a half chance of resisting.

Onboard Locational System-150 credits-You have implanted a chipset that takes in extra sensory data and stores it in an additional memory bank to aid awareness.

Gene Mod List
-------------
Gene mods are typically abilities that can be used in combat. Each requires Gene Mod ranks to develop and has a failure rate given by a function of Brawn, Mod skill and Physical Resistance. If a gene mod fails, it means your body has rejected the use of the biological tampering, and very bad results may follow.

* Unstable Genetics-3 AP, 5 Rejection stacks-Your genetic makeup is highly volatile, and with conscious effort may be changed intentionally to suit your needs. Gain +2 to any primary stat of your choice for up to one hour. Usable twice a day. ON FAILURE: Instead the stat is -2 for an hour.

* Wings-4 AP, 15 Rejection stacks, requires two ranks-You sprout wings and are able to fly for the next 5 minutes before needing to rest/reuse this ability. You may fly at your normal walk speed, and gain 10% dodge modifier against ranged attacks, although you are considered moving for the purposes of shooting even if only hovering. ON FAILURE: In an attempt to produce wings, your spine is racked with pain, dealing damage equal to 20% of your current health rounded up and reducing your remaining AP to zero.

* Corrosive Saliva-4 AP, 5 Rejection stacks-You gain the ability to spit acid at a target or object. Make a ranged attack against your target. If you hit, deal 4D6+Gene Mod x 2 damage. They must then succeed at a Physical Saving Throw (60%+5% x Gene Mod) or gain -2 Awareness for 1 minute and take 2D6 damage at the beginning of the next two of their turns. Usable every three turns. Automatically hits on grappled targets. Deals lots of structural damage. ON FAILURE: Acid wells up in your stomach, dealing 20% of your current health rounded up.
Predatory Stance-4 AP,-10 Rejection stacks, cannot go below 0-Your brain focuses in on your prey, and your body shifts accordingly. Losing the ability for complex thought, you drop anything you were carrying. You gain Brawn and Awareness +2, Wisdom and Intelligence -2. Your unarmed attacks deal 2D6 base damage and your grapples deal unarmed damage at the beginning of each of the grappled target’s turns.  Celerity is increased by 2 ranks. This effect lasts for a minute. ON FAILURE: only get the penalties.

* Regeneration-any amount of AP, 1 Rejection stack per AP used-Your brain coaxes your cells into action, repairing wounds and mending maladies. For each AP that you spend, you gain 10% of your max HP back each turn for a number of turns equal to the AP spent. Over this time period, you also gain an additional Physical save for any ongoing status conditions on the beginning of each of your turns. This action is very tiresome, however. Using it will give Speed -2 until one turn after the effect ends. ON FAILURE: No positive effects, you are just slowed.

* Pheromones-4 AP, 10 Rejection stacks-You exude a chemical that invisibly affects a creature within 30 ft. The creature must succeed at a Mental save of 70% + 5% x Diplomacy skill or be charmed. Usable only once per target and cannot be used more than once every three turns. ON FAILURE: target flies into a rage, targeting you preferentially and becoming immune to diplomacy or mind-affecting abilities originating from you.
