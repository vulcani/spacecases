# Brawn Skills (affected by Brawn attribute)

### Melee Attack

If you hit, deal  damage + Brawn or weapon damage for weapons wielded with two hands.

For each point in Melee, choose a new perk from the list below. Your first point gets you a LVL 1 perk, your second gets you your choice of a level 1 or level 2 perk and so on.

#### LEVEL 1

* Melee Training - +10% to_hit will all melee attacks.

* DoorSword - Wielding a melee weapon two-handed deals 2*Brawn instead of  1.5*Brawn.

#### LEVEL 2

* Visicous technique - Any attack that deals bleed deals one additional bleed.

* Charge - As part of a basic attack, you may move up to your speed before attacking. This invokes AoO.

#### To sort...

* Duel-2 AP Once per turn, you may choose a target to engage. You gain 10% extra dodge modifier against that opponent until the end of the turn and may make a standard melee attack for ½ damage (round up) against them if they attack you and miss. If they attack someone else, you may make this attack automatically and for full damage. This extra attack counts as your attack of opportunity for the round.



* Smash - Standard Attack AP+1 You may make a standard attack against a target within attack range. If it hits, they must make a Physical save (50%+5% x  + 2% x Brawn) or be knocked to the ground. This attack requires a large weapon to use. Usable only once every two turns.

* Charge - 5 AP You may move up 4 AP worth of movement, making a melee attack at the end of the charge. A direct line of movement is needed for this action, but the movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

* Gut Hit - 3 AP You smack an opponent with the back of your weapon or with your fist, knocking the wind out of them. They must make a Mental save (60% + 5% x Melee Attack) or be dazed for two turns. Can be done as an attack of opportunity for no AP cost. Usable once a turn.

### Grapple
-AP Cost varies if holding anything, Base 3 per attempt

Make a grapple check using fists or a grappling tool against an opponent within attack range. Chance to successfully grapple is given by the following function: 		   (50% + [Skill rank + Brawn] x 5% + # size categories larger x 10% + difference in limbs available x 10% + other bonuses – any detriments) - enemy dodge modifier.
Note that this total cannot exceed 95%. If you hit, you and the target is grappled and cannot move or perform any action requiring free limbs. Following a successful grapple and on future turns, each grappled character may choose to attack using a small weapon, store AP and maintain the grapple, or perform a grappling maneuver. You gain a new grappling maneuver at skill ranks 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9...
On subsequent turns, a grappled opponent may attempt to break free for 3 AP. Doing so requires succeeding at a Break Free attempt according to the following function:

(60% + [Dodge Skill rank + Brawn or Speed – enemy Grapple skill rank – enemy Brawn] x 5% + # size categories larger x 10% + difference in limbs available x 10% + other bonuses – any detriments). Note that automatic success or failure is possible here.

* Throwdown-2 AP Throw a target to the ground if you succeed at a grapple check. They take 1D6 + Brawn/2 subdual damage. The grapple is broken on success.
* Arm Break-3 AP Make a grapple check at -10%. If it hits and the target does not make a Physical save (60% + 5% x Grapple skill), their arm (your choice) is broken but the grapple is broken. On failure, the grapple is still broken.

* Drag-1 AP If you succeed at a grapple check, you may move the person along with you at half movement speed. Usable once per turn.
Hit Pressure Point-3 AP Make a grapple check. If it hits and the target does not make a Mental save (80%), they are weakened for 4 rounds.

* Disarm-3 AP This is usable only if an opponent with an equipped weapon is within grapple range. If you succeed at a grapple check, the weapon is thrown to the ground, requiring AP cost equal to its equip cost to pick up again (this action also incurs a melee attack of opportunity). If you succeed by more than 20%, you may kick the weapon in any direction up to 2 x Brawn feet. If you succeed by more than 40%, you may equip the weapon for free, if able. This ability is usable as a response action if you have the AP available and the opponent attempts to attack you or an ally.

### Gene Modification
No inherent active skill(1/1/1/1/2/2/2/2...).

You have dabbled in the dubious art of gene modification, and you have gained abilities and changes because of it. Each rank of gene modification gives one point of modification; refer to the mod list for available abilities and changes. Also, gene mods have a failure rate given by the following Physical save: 
40% + (1% x Rejection stacks) – (2% x Brawn) – (5% x Gene Mod ranks) - Physical save modifier(s), with a minimum failure rate of 1%;
so further ranks decrease the chance of a mod not working. Note that the use of gene modifications within a short time period generate rejection stacks, which indicate the increased chance of rejection brought about through overuse. A number of stacks equal to your Gene Mod ranks fall off every minute.
