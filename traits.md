Traits (like feats):
====================

Traits are like feats in that they give more specific or stranger changes to your character. Each character may start with 2 traits, and gain 1 each level.


* Toughness - You gain 5 base HP, meaning the 20% increase per Endurance is now 9 for each point, etc. Brawn bonuses round down.

* Back up Again - Standing up from knockdown only costs 1 AP and does not incur attacks of opportunity. This trait does not apply if something is making standing up especially difficult.

* Well-Rounded - You have +10% to any miscellaneous skill with which you have no training.

* Arbitrageur - Accumulated personal finances (excess credits) accrue 10% interest in between missions.

* Primed for Action - You gain +20% to all initiative checks.

* Patience - When setting initiative, if you choose to delay your initiative, you gain 1 AP per enemy you allow to act first, up to 3 AP as long as it does not exceed your max AP bank.

* Attuned - You add +10% to all Psionics saves whenever you use psionic abilities, but are more susceptible to mental tampering, losing 10% to all mental saves.

* Fearless - You may reroll one Fear-based save per day, or may give your reroll to any ally who has failed a fear save and is within 50 feet.

* Bully - Your physical attacks add an extra Brawn/2 modifier to damage against any opponents who are stunned, knocked down or crippled.

* Tactical Shooter - You may have 20% dodge modifier from cover for free instead of 10% for the purposes of firing behind cover.

* Bounces Back - Whenever taking major injuries, you may roll on the table twice and take the desired result.

* Junkie - You can reroll any failed save against drug use once.
