### Ranged Attack

Make a ranged attack using an equipped weapon against an opponent within attack range. Chance to hit is given by the following function: (40% + [Skill rank + Awareness] x 5% + other bonuses – 20% if any movement is planned this turn – 10% if the enemy spent AP on movement - any detriments) - enemy dodge modifier. This total cannot exceed 95%. If you hit, deal weapon damage. At ranks described below, gain specializations:

* Sentinel: +10% to_to hit 

* Predator: If a foe is bloodied after you deal weapon-damage, cripple them.

* Eagle Eye: Gain 1 Aim stack whenever you hit by more than 20%.

* Speed Loader: The AP cost to reload any weapon is decreased by 1, to a minimum of 1.

* Head in the Game: If you begin your turn aimed at a foe, gain a 1AP bonus.

* Moving Target: If your target moves, lose 1 aim stack insead of all aim stacks.

#### to sort...
* Rank 2: Sentinel or Skirmisher: If you choose sentinel, you gain a 15% chance to hit if you did not move last turn and will not move this turn. If you choose skirmisher, you have only half the penalty to hit from movement.

* Rank 5: Sniper or Maneuverable: If you choose sniper, you gain double damage if you hit by more than 30%. If you choose Maneuverable, you do not lose effective limbs for using firearms in a grapple and the AP cost to equip a firearm is decreased by 1.

* Cover Fire-Weapon AP Cost-you unload a clip of the weapon you are using to distract an enemy shooter behind cover. Roll 1d100 + Ranged Attack x 5% and keep the number face up. Until your next turn, the enemy’s attacks on allies on your side of enemy cover have a penalty given by your roll, and attempting to leave cover triggers an attack roll against them using your standard hit chance. This can only be performed by a semiautomatic or automatic weapon.

Reload-cost varies by weapon-You reload a clip and may fire again afterwards.

Fire Behind Cover-standard attack AP-You fire from behind cover, allowing you to retain the cover bonus but taking a penalty to your attack roll equal to the dodge modifier given by the cover-10% (a.k.a. the first 10% dodge modifier is free).

Aim-standard attack AP-You prepare to fire on an area, getting a free Perception check on a target line of sight and aiming down your weapon sights until the beginning of your next turn. Until your next turn, you may make an attack of opportunity against any opponents who enter your area of vision detected. This action may only be performed once as the last action of the turn.
