### Skills
Each character has some amount of knowledge that they can put to use. Skills are a measure of knowledge in a given area, which may then be used in a campaign. Each character begins the game at level 1 with skill points given by 5+their Intelligence score. At subsequent levels, characters will receive half of their Intelligence score in skill points, rounded up. Each skill has levels with costs (in skill points) and benefits (in abilities or increased effects). Refer to each skill for these values. This part is rather complicated, so each player should have a copy of this for reference when creating characters. Additionally, almost every action taken in combat will draw upon this list, so detailed notes help speed things up.
Here is the format for skills:
Skill Name-AP Cost (Cost for skill rank 1/cost for rank 2/cost for rank 3...). Description of ability, with any values scaling with character attributes or skill rank listed in parentheses. Special abilities granted by skill ranks are listed last.

# Brawn Skills (affected by Brawn attribute)

### Melee Attack
AP Cost varies by weapon(1/1/1/1/2/2/2/2/3...).

Make a melee attack using an equipped weapon or fists against an opponent within attack range. Chance to hit is given by the following function: (50% + [Skill rank + Brawn] x 5% + other bonuses – any detriments) - enemy dodge modifier. This total cannot exceed 95%. If you hit, deal  damage + Brawn/2 (rounded down) or weapon damage + Brawn for weapons wielded with two hands. At rank 1, you gain a combat maneuver from below. At ranks 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11...gain an additional maneuver. This may be used in place of an ordinary attack as described.
Duel-2 AP Once per turn, you may choose a target to engage. You gain 10% extra dodge modifier against that opponent until the end of the turn and may make a standard melee attack for ½ damage (round up) against them if they attack you and miss. If they attack someone else, you may make this attack automatically and for full damage. This extra attack counts as your attack of opportunity for the round.
Smash-Standard Attack AP+1 You may make a standard attack against a target within attack range. If it hits, they must make a Physical save (50%+5% x  + 2% x Brawn) or be knocked to the ground. This attack requires a large weapon to use. Usable only once every two turns.
Charge-5 AP You may move up 4 AP worth of movement, making a melee attack at the end of the charge. A direct line of movement is needed for this action, but the movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Gut Hit-3 AP You smack an opponent with the back of your weapon or with your fist, knocking the wind out of them. They must make a Mental save (60% + 5% x Melee Attack) or be dazed for two turns. Can be done as an attack of opportunity for no AP cost. Usable once a turn.

### Grapple
-AP Cost varies if holding anything, Base 3 per attempt (1/1/1/1/2/2/2/2/3...).

Make a grapple check using fists or a grappling tool against an opponent within attack range. Chance to successfully grapple is given by the following function: 		   (50% + [Skill rank + Brawn] x 5% + # size categories larger x 10% + difference in limbs available x 10% + other bonuses – any detriments) - enemy dodge modifier.
Note that this total cannot exceed 95%. If you hit, you and the target is grappled and cannot move or perform any action requiring free limbs. Following a successful grapple and on future turns, each grappled character may choose to attack using a small weapon, store AP and maintain the grapple, or perform a grappling maneuver. You gain a new grappling maneuver at skill ranks 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9...
On subsequent turns, a grappled opponent may attempt to break free for 3 AP. Doing so requires succeeding at a Break Free attempt according to the following function:
(60% + [Dodge Skill rank + Brawn or Speed – enemy Grapple skill rank – enemy Brawn] x 5% + # size categories larger x 10% + difference in limbs available x 10% + other bonuses – any detriments). Note that automatic success or failure is possible here.
Throwdown-2 AP Throw a target to the ground if you succeed at a grapple check. They take 1D6 + Brawn/2 subdual damage. The grapple is broken on success.
Arm Break-3 AP Make a grapple check at -10%. If it hits and the target does not make a Physical save (60% + 5% x Grapple skill), their arm (your choice) is broken but the grapple is broken. On failure, the grapple is still broken.
Drag-1 AP If you succeed at a grapple check, you may move the person along with you at half movement speed. Usable once per turn.
Hit Pressure Point-3 AP Make a grapple check. If it hits and the target does not make a Mental save (80%), they are weakened for 4 rounds.
Disarm-3 AP This is usable only if an opponent with an equipped weapon is within grapple range. If you succeed at a grapple check, the weapon is thrown to the ground, requiring AP cost equal to its equip cost to pick up again (this action also incurs a melee attack of opportunity). If you succeed by more than 20%, you may kick the weapon in any direction up to 2 x Brawn feet. If you succeed by more than 40%, you may equip the weapon for free, if able. This ability is usable as a response action if you have the AP available and the opponent attempts to attack you or an ally.

### Gene Modification
No inherent active skill(1/1/1/1/2/2/2/2...).

You have dabbled in the dubious art of gene modification, and you have gained abilities and changes because of it. Each rank of gene modification gives one point of modification; refer to the mod list for available abilities and changes. Also, gene mods have a failure rate given by the following Physical save: 
40% + (1% x Rejection stacks) – (2% x Brawn) – (5% x Gene Mod ranks) - Physical save modifier(s), with a minimum failure rate of 1%;
so further ranks decrease the chance of a mod not working. Note that the use of gene modifications within a short time period generate rejection stacks, which indicate the increased chance of rejection brought about through overuse. A number of stacks equal to your Gene Mod ranks fall off every minute.

# Awareness Skills

### Ranged Attack
AP Cost varies by weapon(1/1/1/1/2/2/2/2/3...).

 Make a ranged attack using an equipped weapon against an opponent within attack range. Chance to hit is given by the following function: (40% + [Skill rank + Awareness] x 5% + other bonuses – 20% if any movement is planned this turn – 10% if the enemy spent AP on movement - any detriments) - enemy dodge modifier. This total cannot exceed 95%. If you hit, deal weapon damage. At ranks described below, gain specializations:
Rank 2: Sentinel or Skirmisher: If you choose sentinel, you gain a 15% chance to hit if you did not move last turn and will not move this turn. If you choose skirmisher, you have only half the penalty to hit from movement.
Rank 5: Sniper or Maneuverable: If you choose sniper, you gain double damage if you hit by more than 30%. If you choose Maneuverable, you do not lose effective limbs for using firearms in a grapple and the AP cost to equip a firearm is decreased by 1.
Rank 7: Speed Loader or Depth of Field: If you choose speed loader, the AP cost to reload any weapon is decreased by 1, to a minimum of 1. If you choose depth of field, the first range increment is free (does not decrease accuracy) and your max range is increased by one increment.
In addition to the specializations, all ranged attackers may perform the following actions:
Cover Fire-Weapon AP Cost-you unload a clip of the weapon you are using to distract an enemy shooter behind cover. Roll 1d100 + Ranged Attack x 5% and keep the number face up. Until your next turn, the enemy’s attacks on allies on your side of enemy cover have a penalty given by your roll, and attempting to leave cover triggers an attack roll against them using your standard hit chance. This can only be performed by a semiautomatic or automatic weapon.
Reload-cost varies by weapon-You reload a clip and may fire again afterwards.
Fire Behind Cover-standard attack AP-You fire from behind cover, allowing you to retain the cover bonus but taking a penalty to your attack roll equal to the dodge modifier given by the cover-10% (a.k.a. the first 10% dodge modifier is free).
Aim-standard attack AP-You prepare to fire on an area, getting a free Perception check on a target line of sight and aiming down your weapon sights until the beginning of your next turn. Until your next turn, you may make an attack of opportunity against any opponents who enter your area of vision detected. This action may only be performed once as the last action of the turn.

### Perception
AP Cost 1 (1/1/1/1/1/1...). 

Attempt to perceive details currently unknown to your character. In combat, this can be used to locate unseen enemies as they traverse cover/etc. or to notice aspects of the environment that may be important. To use this, make a perception check, with % result given by (d100 + Awareness x 5% + Perception x 10%-Range increments of 15 ft. x 5%). If you surpass the % difficulty of a target, you are made aware of any relevant information that you can sense. Some targets have multiple % barriers, yielding more information for higher perception results. At rank 3, the range increment increases to 20 ft. At rank 6, it increases to 30 ft. You also have a passive perception check active on your line of sight equal to Awareness x 5% + Perception x 10%-Range increments of 15 ft. x 5% (equivalent to a roll of zero on an active check). Any attempts to remain undetected in your presence must exceed your passive perception. This skill also aids in initiative, giving a 10% bonus per skill rank.

### Skulk
AP Cost varies by action (1/1/1/1/2/2...). 

This action is the polar opposite of perception, pertaining to any attempts to avoid detection. Each action associated with Skulk is detailed below, and a maneuver may be chosen from among all skulk maneuvers at skill ranks 1, 3, 5, 6, etc.
Sneak-AP Cost 1 If your location is not currently known by someone, you may choose to attempt to sneak. To sneak, declare on your turn that you are sneaking. Movement is done at half speed, and no offensive, loud or otherwise revealing actions may be performed without breaking your cover. When you make your sneak attempt, you set a Perception difficulty of 1d100 + Awareness x 5% + Skulk x 10% for the purposes of detection.
Surprise Attack-AP Cost varies by weapon type Attempt an attack on an unwary opponent. They lose their dodge modifier and take double the base damage if it hits (before armor reduction). Melee weapon damage is tripled instead.
Feint-AP Cost 1 in combat Feint refers to any attempt to disguise your actions or lie. Outside of combat, this check is opposed by enemy Intuition and has a probability of success of:
d100 + 10% x Skulk + 5% x Wisdom – 5% x other’s Wisdom – 10% x other’s Intuition +/- Situational modifiers
In combat, the check is the same but the effect is to hide your actions in combat. They will still hear anything that occurs during your turn but will not receive knowledge of what occurred.
Maneuvers:
Dirty Fighting-3 AP You attempt to distract an enemy with a cheap blow, which disrupts their ability to fight. If you succeed at a Feint-enemy Physical Resistance check, the enemy is stunned on their next turn. Usable once per target per combat and only works on biological creatures.
Cripple-Standard melee attack AP You attempt to cripple an enemy using a well-placed cut. Make an attack against an opponent. If you hit, deal half damage, rounded up. If the opponent does not succeed at a Physical save of 60% + 5% x Skulk skill, they are crippled.

### Endurance Skills
Physical Resistance No associated combat action (1/1/1/1/2/2/2...)

You gain an exceptional ability to shrug off any physical conditions or harm. Your physical saving throw percentages are decreased by 5% per rank + 2% x Endurance. In addition, you gain a maneuver or passive buff at skill ranks 2,4,6,8, etc.:
Take the Hit-1 AP Reaction If there is an ally within 10 feet about to suffer a Physical save or standard attack from an opponent you can see, you may make a Speed check (75% - 5% x Speed) to take their place, rolling for the save and moving the ally in any direction five feet. This is usable only once per combat. On failure, you move next to the ally’s position but do not block the hit. Note that you must have banked some amount of AP to use this ability.
Wound Resistant-The first bleeding stack you take in any situation is negated. This effect is refreshed upon bandaging oneself. Example: If you are shot for bleeding 1 twice in a combat, the first bleeding stack is negated, leaving one stack. If any existing stacks are healed, you may soak another stack for free.
Bounces Back-Your natural healing rate for HP and broken bones/wounds/diseases is double the normal rate.

### Mental Fortitude
No associated combat action (1/1/1/1/2/2/2...)

You gain an exceptional ability to resist any mental conditions or harm. Your mental saving throw percentages are decreased by 5% per rank + 2% x Wisdom. In addition, you gain a maneuver/buff at skill ranks 2,4,6,8, etc.:
Slippery Mind-You are especially resistant to mind control, gaining an extra mental saving throw against any mind control or charm ability at the beginning of each of your turns.
Mind Over Matter-Once per combat, you may use your mental fortitude save modifier against a single physical save.
Awake-You suffer only half the effects from fatigue.
Cybernetic Implant No inherent active skill(1/1/1/1...). You have outfitted yourself with artificial enhancements; they allow you special abilities or bonuses. Each rank of cybernetic implant gives one point of modification; refer to the implant list for available abilities and changes. Many of the mods have stat or ability requirements-falling below these requirements may cause some of the mods to cease functioning.

# Ranged  Skills

### Celerity
AP Cost 1+(1/1/1/1/2/2/2/2...)

You have increased your swiftness of movement through training, and can dash short distances far faster. When moving, you move at a rate given by the following formula:
 (Speed + Celerity ranks) x 1 foot per AP spent
For example, if you are moving 80 feet and have 6 speed and 3 celerity, it will cost 80/9 rounding up to 9 AP to move that distance. You may run on your turn to double your speed, but doing so incurs melee attacks of opportunity (even if not beginning in a threatened zone) and nothing else may be done by that character that turn, although AP may still be banked. You also gain a celerity perk at skill ranks 2, 4, 5, 7, etc. from the list below:
Hard to Pin Down-The penalty to hit you with a ranged attack due to movement that turn is 20% instead of 10% (this penalty applies if you spent AP on movement during the turn before the turn they fire at you).
Controlled Sprinter-Running only provokes attacks of opportunity from leaving a threatened range, not from moving past enemies.
Light on Your Feet-The first 5 feet of movement of a turn have no AP cost and may done each turn for free. Leaving threatened ranges still incurs attacks of opportunity.
The Classic-If you have a free hand, succeeding at a dodge of a thrown weapon by more than 20% gives you control of the object for a free attack on anyone in range.

### Dodge
No associated combat action(1/1/1/1/2/2/2...)

 You have learned how to dodge enemy attacks effectively through a heightened reaction time and quickness. This skill directly influences your dodge modifier and also has associated maneuvers involving quick movement or avoidance. All characters have a dodge modifier given by the following formula:
2% x Speed + 5% x Dodge skill
This modifier is subtracted from any incoming attacks that may be dodged, but is unused in any situations in which you cannot effectively dodge a target, such as being unaware, disabled or something similar. In addition, this skill gives maneuvers/buffs at skill ranks 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. from the following list:
Tactical Roll-2 AP-Move up to ten feet. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity and can move through enemy target spaces.
Redirection-Reaction, 1 AP-If an enemy melee attacker misses by 20% or more, you may use this action to use an enemy’s momentum against them. If they do not succeed at a Physical save of 100%-5% x enemy speed, they are knocked down.
Scrambler-You maintain half of your dodge modifier round up when knocked down.
Evasive Stance-2 AP-If you performed no aggressive actions this turn, gain 20% dodge modifier until the beginning of your next turn. This bonus is lost if you are hit or if you use any reactionary actions before your next turn.

### Adrenaline
No associated combat action; cannot be used untrained (1/1/1/1...)

In periods of great stress or perceived danger, you spring into action in the nick of time. Although you are capable of great feats of strength or ability, you can only summon this extraordinary prowess when the situation truly demands it. Adrenaline is triggered when your character first falls below 40% of their HP or in a situation of great peril, as determined by the GM. During this turn, you gain Speed/2 rounded up AP + 1 AP per skill point and are able to act immediately, often in the middle of an enemy turn. However, the burst of activity will leave you out of breath and unprepared for a drawn-out engagement. At the end of this extra turn, you will be slowed for the next two turns. This is usable only once per combat and gains modifiers on skill levels 2,4,6,8, etc.:
Sudden Strength-Your Brawn is set to 10 during any adrenaline rounds.
Run for Your Life-Movement speed is doubled during adrenaline rounds.
Intense Focus-Your hit chance is increased by 20% during adrenaline rounds.
Courage-You may trigger an adrenaline round on being feared. You will still be feared following the round.
Final Hurrah-You gain an adrenaline round upon being knocked unconscious but not obliterated. This may be in addition to any adrenaline rounds used this combat. If you take additional damage during this round, your round ends immediately.

# Intelligence Skills

###Academics
No associated combat action(1/1/1/1/2/2...)

You are very well educated and may put this knowledge to good use. You have +10% to any knowledge-based skill checks and may use equipment requiring training. Each rank increases the usable academic equipment points by one. Additionally, you gain a specialization at skill ranks listed below:
Rank 2: Major-Pick an area of knowledge (legal, chemistry, engineering, etc.) and gain 20% to any checks related to your area of primary education.
Rank 4: Expert-Pick a single maneuver (non-basic action) and gain 15% to its success rate/save.
Rank 5+: Multidisciplinary Expert-Like Expert, but add a new maneuver to gain 15% for each rank past rank 4. In lieu of taking another expertise, you may instead add a new major.

### Programmer
AP Cost varies by action(1/1/1/1/2/2/2...)

You are a computer expert and excel at any actions related to robotics, hacking, disruption or electronics in general. You also have a mind for your tech resources at hand, and may have a larger amount of tech usefully employed at the same time. A character has tech allowance given by the formula Intelligence/2 round down + Programmer skill rank to use in employing gadgets, and any attempt to interact with computers/devices has its success rate increased by 10% for each skill point. See the tech equipment list for information on programmer uses.

### Psionics
AP Cost varies by ability(1/1/1/1/2/2/2/2/3...)

You are ability to use the power of your mind to affect the world around you. This supernatural ability has been honed as a technique that grows with your investment in both the art and the community and knowledge surrounding it. Read the description of each ability for more information. In general, psionic abilities incur melee attacks of opportunity unless stated otherwise. You understand and can use at least one ability per skill rank; others may be gained over the course of a campaign.

#Wisdom Skills

###Diplomat
3 AP per attempt (1/1/1/2/2/2...)

You are exceptional at reasoning with others, and you may use that skill to great effect. Outside of combat, you gain +10% to all checks involving civil communication/bargaining/etc. While in combat, you may use this skill to bring an early end to a fight using intimidation or reasoning.
Intimidation-You attempt to frighten the enemy team into panicking or surrendering. If you attempt this, roll 1d100/2(round up) + 5% x Diplomat + 2% x Wisdom + 5% x allies killed close by – 20%. Each opponent who can hear you must make a Mental save against this number or be feared until the end of the combat. Some effects may allow rerolls on later turns. If all remaining opponents are feared, the combat ends.
Reasoning-You attempt to reason with the leader of the opposing group to sway them all at once. This may have a dice mechanic at some point, but for now is just role-played.

### Leadership
No associated combat action (2/2/2/2/2/2...)

A leader knows how to bring the best out of a group. They rally the members together and make something better than the sum of its parts. Members of a team within 100 ft of their leader get +5% on all morale based fear checks and surprise checks per skill point of the highest ranking leader. They also have improved finances over the rest of the team, negotiating 20% more starting wealth and earning 20% more from contracts than the average team member per point of leadership. The leader also gains special abilities usable as detailed below. You have access to one per rank and only one may be active at a time:

### Tactician
No primary associated combat action(1/1/1/1/2/2/2...)

Tactician is a skill that gives a character more inherent ability to grasp a situation at hand and act accordingly as a member of a team. It is the opposed skill to the Feint ability and offers abilities at levels 1, 3, 5, 7 and so on that allow team coordination. At levels 2, 4, 6... gain a Tactical Advantage from that level or any lower level. Tacticians also can see exact HP amounts and statuses on allies they can see instead of asking for descriptions.
Abilities:
Reposition-1+ AP-You may use your tactical influence to reposition a willing ally, if able. You may move any number of allies this way up to ten feet each, for one AP each. This movement does not avoid attacks of opportunity.
Hey, Let’s Trade!-1 AP-You yell something out loud to an ally, and then you may each trade an item from a distance of up to twenty feet. The item may not be overly heavy (gm’s discretion), and you do not need to receive anything in return.
